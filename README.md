## Instalation

These are the package that you need for this program to run
- Selenium

You also need to download ChromeDriver version that is similar to you Chrome browser version. Current ChromeDriver Version is `96.0.4664.45`. You can download ChromeDriver at [Here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

If you download a new ChromeDriver, just replace it with the one in this folder / repository.


## Set Up

I have left few comments throughout the code. Just replace these few line with your Credentials and Path:

Replace this with your Matric Number:
```python
MATRIC = 'A123456'
```

Replace this with your Password, (Don't worry, I wont steal it though):
```python
PASSWORD = 'password123'
```

Replace this with your ChromeDriver path.:
```python
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = 'E:\\Python\\SPPP Selenium\\chromedriver.exe'
```
Make sure the ChromeDriver path is correct including the folder name.

Now you can run the code. Enjoyy!!!
