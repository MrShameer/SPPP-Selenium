# About SPPP-Selenium
A selenium automation program to answer all "Penilaian Kursus" for UKM Student. This program uses python.


# Instalation

These are the packages that you need for this program to run :
- Selenium

### !!! Important :
**You also need to download ChromeDriver version that is similar to you Chrome browser version.**

**My Current ChromeDriver Version is `96.0.4664.45`, maybe yours is different. You can download ChromeDriver at [Here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).**

**If you download a new ChromeDriver, just replace it with the one in this folder / repository.**


# Set Up

I have left few comments throughout the code. Just replace these few line with your Credentials and Path:


**Replace this with your Matric Number :**
```python
MATRIC = 'A123456'
```

**Replace this with your Password, (Don't worry, I wont steal it) :**
```python
PASSWORD = 'password123'
```

**Replace this with your ChromeDriver path :**
```python
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = 'E:\\Python\\SPPP Selenium\\chromedriver.exe'
```
### !!! Important :
**Make sure the ChromeDriver path is correct including the folder name. If you download this repository in zip, your folder might be something like `SPPP-Selenium-main`. So make sure you keep note of that.**
